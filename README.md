#Overview
This project demonstrates image steganography, a technique used to securely hide secret messages inside images. It utilizes Python and OpenCV to encode and decode messages by modifying pixel values.

#Technologies Used
- Python – Programming language
- OpenCV (`cv2`) – For image processing
- OS Module – For system-level operations

#Features
- Hide secret messages inside an image.
- Encrypt message with a passcode for security.
- Extract hidden message from the image using the correct passcode.

#Installation
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries.

Install dependencies using:
pip install opencv-python
